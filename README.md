# Quantum Trajectories and Metrology
See the [tutorial](https://ste1nb0ck.github.io/QuTaM.jl/dev/tutorial.html) 
and the full documentation.

Recommended: in case you run into very long precompilation times each time you want to use the library [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3vJSBk0Bls&t=15s).

For a more elaborated example look at `resonance_fluorescene.ipynb`.
